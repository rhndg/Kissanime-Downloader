Download high-res anime video's from Kissanime.com



#####How to use:
    To import from Chrome bookmarks:
      Export Chrome bookmarks as 'bookmarks_%%_%%_%%.html' in the same directory as the python script.
      Running the script will then generate a file named 'anime_list.txt'
    
    Otherwise:
      Create a file named 'anime_list.txt'
      List anime names as they appear in the url at kissanime.com (eg. Akame-ga-Kill)
    
    
    Lines starting with a '#' symbol will be ignored.
	  Adding a '#' symbol after the anime name will allow you to restrict the range of episodes to be downloaded (eg. Akame-ga-Kill#5-7 will download only episodes 5, 6, and 7)
